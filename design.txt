# "Let's Rewrite the Constitution!" - Design Document

## Core Concept
A competitive, gamified platform where users practice logical thinking and precise language creation by tackling constitutional problems. The goal is to teach people how to think systematically about rules, laws, and governance while engaging with real democratic issues.

## Primary Educational Goals
- **Logical Thinking**: Train users to identify problems and create systematic solutions
- **Precise Language**: Practice writing clear, unambiguous rules that actually work
- **Rule Creation**: Understand how laws and governance systems function
- **Critical Analysis**: Examine why existing systems fail and how to improve them
- **Democratic Engagement**: Connect with constitutional issues through active problem-solving

## Game Mechanics

### Challenge Structure
- Each "level" presents a historical constitutional crisis (Dred Scott, Japanese internment, Watergate, post-9/11 surveillance, etc.)
- Players submit their version of constitutional language to fix the problem
- Community votes on submissions based on **clarity and effectiveness**
- Winning entries become part of the final constitutional document

### Scoring System
**Primary Criteria: "Clearest logic that creates workable rules"**
- Is the reasoning sound and logical?
- Are the rules clear and unambiguous?
- Could this actually function as law?
- Does it solve the stated problem without creating new ones?
- Can people understand and follow these rules?

**Focus on Process, Not Product**: The value is in learning to think systematically about governance, not in producing a final document.

### Gamification Elements
- User levels/badges ("Constitutional Scholar," "Amendment Author")
- Leaderboards for "most adopted language"
- Achievement system
- Progress tracking on document completion
- Edit counters and contribution stats
